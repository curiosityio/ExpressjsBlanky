# nodemon to make auto restart node when compiled sources change.

#    You can also use 'source-map-support' npm package if this built-in node arg doesn't work.
# --async-stack-traces to make stacktraces have better support for async/await code. You no longer lose parts of your stacktrace when an error occurs.
