Hello, there! **At this time, ExpressjsBlanky does not accept any contributions**. It is a very opinionated project for the way that I build apps. 

However, **I do accept**:

* Corrections to the documentation. 
* Bug fixes. 

If you do not have one of these, I may decline your pull request. If you are unsure, go ahead and open the pull request. I will get back to you ðŸ˜Š.
